Model Explanation

This computational model simulates synaptic plasticity at a crucial synapse for memory consolidation: the connection from a presynaptic CA3 pyramidal neuron to a postsynaptic CA1 pyramidal neuron via the Schaffer collateral pathway in the hippocampus. The model visualizes Long Term Potentiation (LTP), a long-lasting enhancement in signal transmission that serves as a primary cellular mechanism for learning and memory. The y-axis, Synaptic Weight, is a quantitative proxy for synaptic efficacy, representing the number and sensitivity of postsynaptic AMPA receptors. An increase in this weight means that the synapse has been strengthened. The model compares three conditions to directly address how Alzheimer's disease (AD) impairs this process and how a targeted therapy might restore it.

The Healthy Control (blue line) establishes a functional baseline. During the super high stimulation period from about 40-45s, the simulated high-frequency firing of the CA3 neuron creates high LTP. This causes the steep learning curve going upward. This is governed by a high learning_rate parameter, which represents the high efficiency of the healthy molecular mechanism(e.g., NMDA receptor activation, calcium influx) that drives the insertion of AMPA receptors. The resulting high plateau shows the successful and persistent strengthening of the synapse, which basically means that memory has been successfully encoded.

The Alzheimer's Disease (AD) model (red dashed line) illustrates a pathological failure of this mechanism. Despite identical stimulation, the synaptic weight shows negligible potentiation. This models how, in early AD, pathological factors like amyloid-beta oligomers can disrupt NMDA receptor function and downstream signaling pathways. This biological impairment is represented by a dramatically reduced learning_rate and maximum weight (w_max), leading to a nearly flat curve that signifies a profound failure to induce LTP and, by extension, an inability to form new long-term memories.

The AD + Treatment model (green dotted line) directly tests the research hypothesis. Here, a simulated therapy restores the learning_rate and w_max parameters to healthy levels. The resulting curve almost perfectly overlaps the healthy control, demonstrating a complete rescue of LTP. This powerful visualization suggests that a treatment targeting the specific molecular machinery of synaptic plasticity could restore the Schaffer collateral pathway's fundamental ability to strengthen its connections, thereby re-enabling the cellular processes required for memory consolidation.
